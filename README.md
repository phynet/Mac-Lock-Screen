# Mac-Lock-Screen

1.- Download this automator command, double click and install.

2.- Configure in `System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Services -> LockScreen` and configure your `hot keys`. Mine is command + control + ยก (works everytime :D)

I know this capture is in spanish, but that's how my mac is configured. Just follow instructions ;)
